# format-arm README

A small extension to make formatting of ARM assembly code easier.<br>
Designed to be used in conjunction with the ARM instruction set used in teaching at the University of Manchester, so compatibility with other instruction sets is not guaranteed.

## Features
Provides a single command, `Format ARM`, which will align comments and similar blocks of code, for example `DEFW` blocks.
